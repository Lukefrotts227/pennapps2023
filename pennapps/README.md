Inspiration
To take action against performative activism in a world where individuals chase social admiration as opposed to the general good.

What it does
Every week, individuals are given challenges to help promote sustainability. They are able to post a picture anonymously of them performing the action. The posts can also be liked. Users can view these anonymous posts. The user information and posts are saved in the MongoDB Atlas database.

How we built it
We built our application user interface using the React Javascript framework. The user interface was styled with tailwindcss which allowed us to have a clean finish to our final product. The Backend server was made using the express node javascript framework. For the database, we decided to use MongoDB for the flexibility and easy ability to connect to remotely.

Challenges we ran into
Due to the local wifi, we were unable to connect to our database for a long time because of the firewall security issues. After we switched to a mobile hotspot, the database was able to function, however, it was not to our standards.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of, despite having many obstacles, being able to overcome the challenges and still being able to produce a product though not to our standards.

What we learned
We learned how to work with the MERN stack with specific API packages like multer.
